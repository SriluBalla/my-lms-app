          </h2>
          <p>
            While traditional QA roles have played a critical part in software
            development, the introduction of the{" "}
            <strong>Product Owner in Test™ (POT)</strong> represents a paradigm
            shift. This section explores how POT differs fundamentally from QA,
            not just in responsibilities but in mindset, structure, and product
            ownership.

                <b>QA</b> is traditionally positioned within development teams

                stories or tickets. Their role is primarily reactive — verifying
                that a feature works as intended based on acceptance criteria
                and reporting issues found.

                product’s lifecycle. The focus is not on verifying tasks, but on
                owning and exploring the product itself. This role ensures that
                the product’s quality, integrity, and functionality are
                evaluated holistically — outside the confines of sprint tickets
                or process constraints.
